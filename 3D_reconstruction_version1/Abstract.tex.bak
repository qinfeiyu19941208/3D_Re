\begin{abstract}
Extracting buildings from remote sensing images plays an important role in urban applications (e.g., urban planning and digital city).
%
However, this task is quite difficult due to the great diversity of buildings and similarities between buildings and other categories.
%
Recent approaches have attempted to harness the capabilities of deep learning techniques for building extraction.
%
In this paper, we propose a robust method which extracts buildings from large-scale remote sensing images efficiently via deep learning. 
%
And we further build 3D models for extracted building areas.
%
Learning low-level appearance information and high-level semantic information are equally important since buildings in remote images possess various scales and aspect ratios.
%
Hence, in order to make full use of the information extracted from each layer, we propose a simple but effective hierarchical fusion operation which fuses the feature maps between channels stage by stage.
%
In this paper, we present a novel network named hierarchical fused fully convolution network(HF-FCN) which fuses the information within the group and between groups.
%
Additionally, The experiments on several available remote sensing image datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
%
It is also a attempt for further application that combining the building detection via deep learning with available Digital Surface Model (DSM) map to 3D modeling.

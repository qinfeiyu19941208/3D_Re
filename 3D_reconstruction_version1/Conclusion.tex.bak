\section{Conclusion}
\label{Sec:Con}
 In this paper, an efficient building detection approach is proposed and have a further application in building reaconstruction. A novel CNN architecture, HF-FCN, combines hierarchical semantic layers and multi-scale feature representation to implement final building detection. We design a fusion branch to combine the feature maps stage by stage. And the resulting HF-FCN method shows significant improvements over previous methods. Distinct from the previous deeplearning based methods, we utilize the multi-scale inherent information within the CNN and refine the details. Unlike existing 3D reconstruction methods, our proposed approach relies on the HF-FCN to efficiently extract the area of buildings to build the 3D models of the geospatial objects. Finally, our study suggests that even with the powerful semantic expressive ability of CNNs and their good robustness to scale, it is still critical to address multi-scale problems utilizing hierarchical feature maps encoded in CNNs.

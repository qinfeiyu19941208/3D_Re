\section{Conclusion}
\label{Sec:Con}
 In this paper, an efficient building detection approach is proposed and has a further application in building reconstruction.
 Using proposed feature fusion operations, a novel CNN architecture is presented for building extraction, named HF-FCN.
 Unlike previous shallow-CNNs algorithms, we provide an end-to-end network for building extraction.
 And it is robust to the different scales of buildings and efficient for a large-scale remote sensing images.
 On the other hand, distinct from the previous deep learning based methods, we utilize the multi-scale inherent information within the CNN and refine the details by a fusion manner stage by stage.
 In addition, an application of 3D building reconstruction depend on the segmentation results is implemented.
 Finally, our study suggests that even with the powerful semantic expressive ability of CNNs and their good robustness to scale, it is still critical to address multi-scale building extraction problem by utilizing hierarchical feature maps encoded in CNNs.
